### UPDATE 2018 06 21:  
Despite not having written very much code for the past week, I've completed a significant amount of reading around the subject of Django, and also data science. I will upload my progress through the Django initial tutorial that I have been playing with. Beyond that I have stubled across a website called "mybinder.org" that takes any jupyter github code and can run it through their services. 

Since I have essentially learned the majority of the syntax of python thus far I intend on applying as much as possible as toon as possible. I've come across libraries such as scikitlearn, pandas, requests, beautifulsoup, matplotlib, and bokeh (for some cutting edge visualizations). The direction I would like to go in next is related to data science. I want to spend some of these 100 days starting with basic data science problems and try to work up to a reasonable application of one of a few propblems I've concidered over the past week. 

#### TODO: Move updates to a separate file called "blog" or something of the sort. - DONE!    
#### TODO: Implement jupyter notebook based code and upload it to github for use with mybinder.org.

Taking a break from Django for a little while. Started to research and play around with a Kaggle competitions. I've been reading through and following this kernal on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/start-here-a-gentle-introduction
This is a link that has an excellent explanation of ROC AUC: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/132777/what-does-auc-stand-for-and-what-is-it which is used as a determination of effectiveness of a predictive model. As of this time this method is concidered the 
latest best practice for data science models. ... And here is another explenation that explains ROC AUC a slightly different way: https://web.archive.org/web/20160407221300/http://metaoptimize.com:80/qa/questions/988/simple-explanation-of-area-under-the-roc-curve.   
I've also been reading the book "Data Science from Scratch: First Principles with Python" by Joel Grus. It has been an excellent book so far, however I would like to complain about the fact that it is written in python2.7 instead of python3. Fortunately the author has went back
and posted all of the books code in python3 at this github: https://github.com/joelgrus/data-science-from-scratch/tree/master/code-python3.

#### TODO: Complete reading Joel Grus' book. Finish researching and comprehending: https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/start-here-a-gentle-introduction to immmprove my understanding of kaggle based competitions.
