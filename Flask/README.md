## Flask Stuff:
### Blog:   
My first project with flask is a basic blog using SQLAlchemy, possibly Marshamallow(Serialization/Deserialization), Flask-WTF (for forms), 
and finally bootstrap (I'm not commited to bootstrap though).   

### Web Page:
My next project will be a personal webpage to use as a portfolio and link to my github describing my projects.
