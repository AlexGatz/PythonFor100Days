### UPDATE 2018 06 21:  
 Despite not having written very much code for the past week, I've completed a significant amount of reading around the subject of Django, and also data science. I will upload my progress through the Django initial tutorial that I have been playing with. Beyond that I have stumbled across a website called "mybinder.org" that takes any jupyter github code and can run it through their services. 
 
 Since I have essentially learned the majority of the syntax of python thus far I intend on applying as much as possible as soon as possible. I've come across libraries such as scikitlearn, pandas, requests, beautifulsoup, matplotlib, and bokeh (for some cutting edge visualizations). The direction I would like to go in next is related to data science. I want to spend some of these 100 days starting with basic data science problems and try to work up to a reasonable application of one of a few problems I've considered over the past week. 

 #### TODO: Move updates to a separate file called "blog" or something of the sort. - DONE!    
 #### TODO: Implement jupyter notebook based code and upload it to github for use with mybinder.org.

Taking a break from Django for a little while. Started to research and play around with a Kaggle competitions. I've been reading through and following this kernal on kaggle:[StartHereAGentleIntroduction](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/start-here-a-gentle-introduction)
This is a link that has an excellent explanation of ROC AUC: [WhatIsAucRoc](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/132777/what-does-auc-stand-for-and-what-is-it) which is used as a determination of effectiveness of a predictive model. As of this time this method is considered the 
latest best practice for data science models. ... And here is another explenation that explains ROC AUC a slightly different way: [AnotherThingAboutAucRoc](https://web.archive.org/web/20160407221300/http://metaoptimize.com:80/qa/questions/988/simple-explanation-of-area-under-the-roc-curve).   
I've also been reading the book "Data Science from Scratch: First Principles with Python" by Joel Grus. It has been an excellent book so far, however I would like to complain about the fact that it is written in python2.7 instead of python3. Fortunately the author has went back
and posted all of the books code in python3 at this github: [BookPython3Code](https://github.com/joelgrus/data-science-from-scratch/tree/master/code-python3).

#### TODO: Complete reading Joel Grus' book. Finish researching and comprehending: The "Gentle Introduction" ... lol ... to improve my understanding of kaggle based competitions.

Data Science: Thus far I have learned a significant amount about not only what data science is but also how it is completed using Python. So far I'm really only scratching the surface, but I feel that I am able to import, clean, manipulate, and explore datasets pretty nicely. I'm finding that a significant amount of the code used to complete these tasks can be completed in pandas, and visualized using matplotlib. My comfort with answering obscure questions related to different aspects of data has increased greatly. My next task concerning data science is going to be feature engineering as this is a exceedingly important aspect of machine learning based models. A first step I would like to take is exploring a tool I found called "Featuretools" based on this [paper](http://www.jmaxkanter.com/static/papers/DSAA_DSM_2015.pdf) written by James Max Kanter and Kalyan Veeramachaneni from MIT. The tools attempt to automate the process of feature engineering by completing what they term as "deep feature synthesis". There are also methods of tuning the process to get better results. The paper showed that as of May 18th 2015 using their software they had 95.7% of the top submission scores for the KDD cup 2015 out of 277 teams. Very interesting results.   


Web dev: I'm just getting to this [part](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/tutorial03/) of the django tutorials. I haven't spent very much time learning django. Some things I'm interested in trying to make are: a chat app, a personal website, a blog on that website perhaps, a website keeping track of different data science studies I would like to conduct. For the chat app I'm interested in trying to use microservices instead of a monolithic style app. There would be a: chat bot service, push service (to push updates to everyone in the chat), users service, authorization service(tokens), messages service(adds and stores messages when a user types a message), UI service(that will serve up the HTML, CSS, JS to the client) and perhaps others I'm still working out the specifics of this. I've read a little about using flask vs django for microservice based application, however I have not found the rationale behind this choice at this time.

Sooooo that's where I'm at with my 100 days of python so far! I will be uploading some code when I get home updating what I've completed so far in the Django tutorial, and I need to put some of the work I've been doing with jupyter notebook into a nice neat concise place and on github so that's is what I will be doing soon.

Alright! First I would like to note that I believe I have fell into a terrible loop of "analysis paralysis" or perhaps some sort of "research paralysis" where I have found myself reading over an order of magnitude more than I've been coding. That stops today!   
Data Science: I'm putting all data science research and reading on hold starting today. I have found that I can get lost in more interesting reading than I have time to produce any decent results with. Also I would like to tackle setting up a personal webpage.   

Web Dev: Here again I have been reading significantly more than I've been coding. Throughout my readings I have found that Django may not be what I thought it was. I've never used a web framework before; what I had imagined it being is not what Django is. When they say "batteries included" they don't just mean the batteries they mean the whole house is included with this framework. I have decided to switch gears and start working with something called [Pyramid](https://trypyramid.com/). At this time pyramid appears to be exactly what I'm looking for. It can be as simple or as complicated as I would like it to be. So far I've just glimpsed through the tutorials and I'm excited to sit down and put together something as soon as possible. For over a month now I've been listening to [Talk Python To Me](https://talkpython.fm/) which is a fantastic strickly python podcast that I would highly recommend to anyone. According to the host, he uses Pyramid as he describes on [Episode #149](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/149/4-python-web-frameworks-compared) where the host, Michael Kennedy, speaks with his guest about 4 different web frameworks. Pyramid was one of them. 

#### TODO: BREAK THE ANALYSIS PARALYSIS LOOP!!!
#### TODO: Learn enough pyramid to get the backend of a blog/personal webpage started and post updates to github!
