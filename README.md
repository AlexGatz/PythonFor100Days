# PythonFor100Days
I'm trying to dedicate my time to using python every day for 100 days. I will add new code as I learn, but I will not be adding new code every day for 100 days. 

UPDATE 2018 06 21:
Despite not having written very much code for the past week, I've completed a significant amount of reading around the subject of Django, and also data science. I will upload my progress through the Django initial tutorial that I have been playing with. Beyond that I have stubled across a website called "mybinder.org" that takes any jupyter github code and can run it through their services. 

Since I have essentially learned the majority of the syntax of python thus far I intend on applying as much as possible as toon as possible. I've come across libraries such as scikitlearn, pandas, requests, beautifulsoup, matplotlib, and bokeh (for some cutting edge visualizations). The direction I would like to go in next is related to data science. I want to spend some of these 100 days starting with basic data science problems and try to work up to a reasonable application of one of a few propblems I've concidered over the past week. 

TODO: Move updates to a separate file called "blog" or something of the sort. 
TODO: Implement jupyter notebook based code and upload it to github for use with mybinder.org.
